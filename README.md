# Random Shooter

This is a simple unity project for teaching shooting mechanics, random object generation and a bit of PCG to SBU students.

## Improvements

- Add the Enemies from Session-9 back to the game.
- Generate corridors in other directions.
- Make the Rooms progressively harder by increasing the number of enemies.
- Make the enemies follow a moving player.
- write the room generation function with 4 for loops and change the wall-unit prefab.
- Make rectangular rooms.
- Add a speed boost button for the player with a small cooldown.
- Set the `minRoomSize` to something less than the half of `maxRoomSize`. Run the game for several times, do you see any bugs? How can you fix it?
- Fix the last room having an open right wall bug.
